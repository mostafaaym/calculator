The assignment involves creating an Android calculator app using Kotlin, focusing on user interface design, user input handling, and arithmetic operations. Here is a breakdown of the key requirements:

1.	Name Input Screen:

o	Develop an initial screen allowing the user to input their name.

o	Utilize view binding to handle UI elements.

o	Include a "Submit" button for transitioning to the calculator screen.

2.	Calculator Screen:

o	After the user submits their name, display a greeting message.

o	Design a well-organized layout with buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and special functions (clear, equals).

o	Ensure the visual appeal of the calculator screen.

3.	View Binding:

o	Utilize view binding throughout the application for efficient interaction with UI elements.

4.	Functionality:

o	Implement basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

o	Allow users to input numbers and select operators.

o	Include a "C" (Clear) button to reset input and results.

o	Implement an "=" (Equals) button to display the result of calculations.

5.	Error Handling:

o	Gracefully handle errors, such as division by zero or invalid input.

o	Display appropriate error messages to guide users when needed.

6.	Code Quality:

o	Emphasize clean and well-documented code.

o	Use meaningful variable and function names for clarity and maintainability.

This assignment encourages a holistic approach, encompassing UI/UX design, functionality, and code quality in the development of a user-friendly Android calculator app. The use of Kotlin and view binding enhances the development process, providing a foundation for creating a robust and effective mobile application.
